    <h1>Good healthy food</h1>
    <p>The first recipe is not actually food, it is for a nice cup of tea:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm the cup with boiling water</li>
            <li>Brew the tea bag in fresh water for 3 minutes</li>
            <li>Remove the tea bag.  Add sugar if you don't actually want to taste the tea (grr...)</li>
            <li>Enjoy a nice cup of tea and all is better :)</li>
        </ol>
    <p>The ingredients are pretty straight forward:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tea Bag</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>And that's all...</li>
        </ul>
