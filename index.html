			<p>The first recipe is not actually food, it is for a nice cup of tea:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Warm the cup with boiling water</li>
				<li>Brew the tea bag in fresh water for 3 minutes</li>
				<li>Remove the tea bag.  Add sugar if you don't actually want to taste the tea (grr...)</li>
				<li>Enjoy a nice cup of tea and all is better :)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The ingredients are pretty straight forward:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Tea Bag</li>
				<li>Water</li>
				<li>Milk</li>
				<li>And that's all...</li>
			</ul>

		<p>For an alternative, and far more detailed recipe for making tea, I recommend George Orwells essay <a href="http://theorwellprize.co.uk/george-orwell/by-orwell/essays-and-other-works/a-nice-cup-of-tea/">A Nice Cup of Tea</a></p>

			<summary title="If you're lucky, your browser will show these as collapsable sections!">Scrambled Eggs</summary>
			<p>The second recipe is actually the first actual food recipe, it is for scrambled eggs:</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="http://cdn.jamieoliver.com/recipe-database/oldImages/xtra_med/997_1_1439308218.jpg" alt="Scrambled eggs on toast" title="Yum yum!" height="250">
				<figcaption>These scrambled eggs were made by Jamie Oliver, but your's will be better because they are made by you :)</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<ol>
				<li>Warm olive oil in a frying pan while beating the egg, milk and pepper together</li>
				<li>Pour the milky, peppery eggs into the frying pan</li>
				<li>Stir occasionally, until cooked</li>
				<li>Serve on some buttered toast, and some tea, for a great start to the day :)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The ingredients are pretty straight forward again...:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Eggs</li>
				<li>Milk (which you already have for the <a href="#tea">tea</a>!)</li>
				<li>Pepper</li>
				<li>Olive oil</li>
			</ul>

		<summary title="If you're lucky, your browser will show these as collapsable sections!">Breakfast Biscuits and Coffee</summary>
		<p>The third recipe is for food again, but for days when sleep is good and work starts soon :(</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="http://www.belvitabreakfast.com/~/media/belVita/com/images/amc/golden-oats.png" alt="Belvita breakfast biscuits" title="For when sleep is good, and work is near - these are at least quick..." height="125">
			<figcaption>One type of breakfast biscuit among many.</figcaption>
		</figure>
			<ol>
				<li>Before you leave the house, pick up the breakfast biscuits and the coffee money</li>
				<li>Spend the coffee money on a coffee (complicated this!)  Tea is a rip-off in coffee shops and they don't even do it <a href="#tea">right</a>!</li>
				<li>Read e-mails at your desk, eating the breakfast biscuits and sipping coffee</li>
			</ol>
		<p>The ingredients are really simple:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Breakfast biscuits</li>
				<li>Money for a coffee (£1.70 for me)</li>
				<li>The dream of the weekend</li>
			</ul>
